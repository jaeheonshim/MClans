&0&nClans Guide&r\n\n&0This book is a guide on how to use the clans feature built into the plugin. This feature allows you to claim land and protect it from outside modification.

&0&nPart 3: Claiming land&r\n\n&0You can claim land in chunks, 1 chunk at a time. To claim land, run the command {/clan claim} while standing in the chunk you want to claim. Land your clan claims will only be modifiable by members of your clan.
&0&nPart 4: Unclaiming land&r\n\n&0You can also unclaim land using the command {/clan unclaim} while standing in the chunk you want to unclaim. You can also specify chunk coordinates in the command like so:\n\n{/clan unclaim 13 43}
